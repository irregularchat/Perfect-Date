# Two-Location Dating Feature Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision
Enable couples coming from different locations to find optimal meeting venues that minimize travel for both people, using intelligent midpoint calculation and distance-based search optimization.

## 📋 Current State Analysis
- **Current**: Single location input (user's location or manually entered)
- **Limitation**: Suboptimal for people coming from different areas
- **Pain Point**: One person always travels further than necessary

## 🔬 Research Findings

### Existing Solutions Analysis
Based on research of current tools in 2024:

**Popular Meet-in-the-Middle Tools:**
- **MeetWays**: Restaurants/cafes halfway between addresses
- **Whatshalfway.com**: Supports 120+ countries with Meeting Planner
- **Midpointr**: Group meeting optimization with traffic data
- **Findaspot**: Uses real-time traffic for travel time-based centers
- **Meedol** (Mobile): Simple two-address midpoint finder

**Key Insights:**
- Most tools focus on simple geographic midpoint
- Advanced tools use travel time vs. straight-line distance
- Integration with Yelp/Google for venue recommendations is standard
- Real-time traffic data significantly improves accuracy

### Technical Algorithms Researched

**1. Geographic Midpoint Calculation**
- **Haversine Formula**: Great-circle distance on sphere
- **Performance**: 200,000-500,000 calculations/second
- **Accuracy**: ~0.5% margin due to Earth's non-perfect sphere
- **Implementation**: Convert lat/lng → cartesian → back to geographic

**2. Distance-Based Search Radius**
- **Proximity-based recommendations**: Used in food delivery, dating apps
- **Optimization strategy**: Percentage of total distance
- **Performance considerations**: Balance accuracy vs. computation time

**3. Center of Minimum Distance**
- **Algorithm**: Minimizes total travel distance for all participants
- **Advantage**: More fair than simple geographic center
- **Use case**: When optimizing for travel time vs. geographic fairness

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Sprint 1-2)
**Backend Changes:**
- [ ] Add `date_location` parameter to API endpoints
- [ ] Implement Haversine distance calculation function
- [ ] Create geographic midpoint calculation using center-of-gravity method
- [ ] Add distance-based search radius algorithm
- [ ] Update venue search to support midpoint + radius parameters

**Technical Specifications:**
```python
def calculate_midpoint_and_radius(location1, location2):
    """
    Calculate optimal meeting point and search radius
    
    Args:
        location1: (lat, lng) tuple for person 1
        location2: (lat, lng) tuple for person 2
    
    Returns:
        midpoint: (lat, lng) tuple for search center
        radius: int search radius in meters
    """
    distance_km = haversine_distance(location1, location2)
    midpoint = geographic_midpoint(location1, location2)
    
    # Smart radius based on distance between locations
    if distance_km < 8:      # Close by (< 5 miles)
        radius = min(4800, distance_km * 1000 * 0.6)  # 60%, max 3 miles
    elif distance_km < 32:   # Medium distance (< 20 miles)
        radius = min(16000, distance_km * 1000 * 0.4) # 40%, max 10 miles  
    elif distance_km < 80:   # Long distance (< 50 miles)
        radius = min(24000, distance_km * 1000 * 0.3) # 30%, max 15 miles
    else:                    # Very long distance
        radius = min(40000, distance_km * 1000 * 0.2) # 20%, max 25 miles
    
    return midpoint, int(radius)
```

- [ ] "Fairness score" showing how equitable the location is
- [ ] Alternative venue suggestions if one person travels significantly more
- [ ] Public transit directions when available

### Phase 4: Intelligence & Personalization (Sprint 6)
**AI-Powered Suggestions:**
- [ ] Learn from user preferences for distance tolerance
- [ ] Suggest optimal meeting times based on traffic patterns
